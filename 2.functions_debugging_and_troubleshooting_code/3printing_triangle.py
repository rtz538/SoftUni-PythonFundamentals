# EXERCISE
# Create a function for printing triangles as shown in the EXAMPLES section below.


# EXAMPLES:
#
# Input
# 3
#
# Output
# 1
# 1 2
# 1 2 3
# 1 2
# 1
#
#
# Input
# 4
#
# Output
# 1
# 1 2
# 1 2 3
# 1 2 3 4
# 1 2 3
# 1 2
# 1

# HINTS:
#
# 1. After you read the input.
# 2. Start by creating a function for printing a single line from a given start to a given end. \
# Choose a meaningful name for it, describing its purpose.
# 3. Think how you can use it to solve the problem.
# 4. After you spent some time thinking, you should have come to the conclusion that you will need two loops
# 5. In the first loop you can print the first half of the triangle without the middle line.
# 6. Next, print the middle line.
# 7. Lastly, print the rest of the triangle.
